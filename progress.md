## Header UI & Responsiveness

- **Created a responsive header component** featuring:
  - A site logo with styled heading (`Stock Master`).
  - Navigation links: Home, Analytics, Users, About Us.
  - Two buttons: default button and "Join Now" button with custom styles.
  - Hamburger menu icon (using React Icons) for mobile navigation toggle.

- **Implemented responsive design:**
  - Desktop: Full navigation visible alongside buttons.
  - Mobile & Tablet (screens â‰¤ 900px): 
    - Navigation and buttons hide by default.
    - Hamburger icon displayed.
    - On hamburger toggle, navigation menu slides in smoothly from the right in a vertical column layout.
    - Close icon replaces hamburger when menu is open.

- **CSS improvements:**
  - Used CSS variables for consistent theming.
  - Added smooth slide-in/out transition animations for nav menu.
  - Proper layering using z-index to ensure menu overlays content.

- **React state management:**
  - Controlled menu open/close state with `useState`.
  - Toggle function bound to hamburger icon clicks.
